## Distinctiveness and Complexity:
- More than one app with models that have a more complex relation and influence each other.
- Uses React, ajax functionality, fetch data without reloading the page.
- Hide poll feature to avoid listing active poll in home index
- Can vote for one only candidate in a category, prevents double voting by same user
- Send password reset code using email.
- Upload keys from excel, and download keys as excel
- 4 digit OTP generation, to be sent via twilio messaging services
- Completely Mobile responsive.
- Various checks and restrictions are implemented on multiple models to ensure smooth running, such as on launching a poll, checks to - remove empty empty groups and categories, any votes before launch,etc
- Also unit tests have been introduced to make sure the apps run as intended. 
- Timeout if account inactive for 1800s, requiring logging in again

## Additional Info:
- Twilio service needs auth thus has been deactivated from sending messages, OTP is printed in the cmd terminal instead
- Email deactivated
